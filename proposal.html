                        <p><b>Summary: </b> We will be creating the rainbow road simulation from the driverâ€™s point of view and adding random objects throughout the ride.
                                            The environment around the road will change through different scenes like going through space, a glass tunnel surrounded by water, and a mineshaft (maybe).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                        <p><b>Context: </b> We began brainstorming by thinking of different light effects in different scenes.
                                            Then, we thought of a roller coaster and the Mario Kart tracks.
                                            We saw those images and were inspired to make our own track with cool items and objects along the way, and this is the result of that.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Problem we are trying to solve: </b> With all the unique objects in the environment of the road, we would have to tackle how the environment looks to the camera at different positions in world space.
                                                                   Each object has its own properties in how it may reflect, refract, or absorb light, and we need to render images that accurately represent those qualities.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Importance: </b> We show how different environments and materials can look through ray-tracing and consider properties such as the index of refraction of different substances.</p>
                        <p><b>Challenging parts: </b> Understanding and modeling the effects of those properties on light as that light gets reflected back to the moving camera will be difficult.</p>
                        <h2>Goals & Deliverables</h2>
                        <p>Our main focus will be how different materials affect light. Our demo will be a video from the perspective of the rider going through the ride.</p>
                        <p><b>What we plan to deliver: </b> Our main goal is to create the two or three different scenes that the ride will go through. We will be focusing on different computer graphics techniques in each environment.</p>
                        <p>Our first setting will be in space. This focuses on light reflectance and refraction as the rainbow road will be semi-transparent where you can see some of the stars in the background. There will also be planets and asteroids that will move and rotate. (See below for a reference.)</p>
                        <figure> <img src="assets/img/space-scene.png" style="width:70%"/> </figure>
                        <p>Our next setting will be in a glass tunnel surrounded by water. This focuses on light refraction effects to deal with the water and glass in the dome. (See below for a reference.)</p>
                        <figure> <img src="assets/img/water-scene.png" style="width:70%"/> </figure>
                        <p><b>What we hope to achieve: </b> 
                            <ul>  
                                <li> We want to add another setting that will be in a mineshaft, which will include glowing ores as light. This focuses on light reflectance and refraction as there will be light from the rainbow road and from the ores.</li>
                                <li> Instead of having the camera above the road, we will add the camera inside a cart and have the point of view from be right above the cart.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p> We will measure the quality of our system by checking if we can see through the road in space, if the objects in the water have a tint over it and change in size to make it seem like they are in water, and if each ore is able to emit their own light.</p>
